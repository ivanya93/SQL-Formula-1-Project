-- 2. Defining the problem we are trying to solve

-- General Info about F1:
-- 1. What countries compete in F1?
-- 2. Find the country that has hosted the most F1 races.
-- 3. Find the circuit that has hosted the most F1 races.

-- About the racer:
-- 1. Find the AVG/max/min time difference between the 1st, 2nd and 3rd runners.
-- 2. Find the constructor that has won the most races in F1
-- 3. Find the driver that has won the most races in F1
-- 4. Find the fastest stop in history. 

-- Investigate the relationships:
-- 1. Compare the nationality of the champion and the hosting country
-- 2. Find the F1 top speed record, its correlated circuit and its constructor
-- 3. Find the AVG/sum/count of the pole position (q1, q2, q3) and the winners 
-- 4. Correlation between duration of pit stops and time to win race/reach the end line.
-- 5. Find the AVG pit stop duration by each constructor in each year
-- 6. Find the avg pit stop by circuit
-- 7. The curse of number 13:
	-- >Does number 13 lost the most races?
	-- Does number 13 have more accidents/disqualify than other racers?
